# My Personal Website!
My very own personal website for fun/remembering cool things/practicing my React!

## Development
This site will be built with React/Gatsby!

## Road Map
The plans for future development of this website...

* Build landing page to house CV, About Me, fun graphics, and yep!
* Timeline of my university career for myself, because I am bad at remembering all the fun things
* Different cool sections...
  * Photography,
  * Music/songs I want to remember,
  * Projects/blog page,
  * Some other cool ones!!

Don't really know when I will start this or where it will go, but it should be fun :)
